# 🧪 Matthias Threat Lab

Hi there — and welcome to my personal cybersecurity playground!  

This is where I document my journey **from zero to malware analyst**, sharing experiments, code, and lessons learned as I explore malware analysis, reverse engineering, and low-level programming.  

Everything here is part of my learning process — expect mistakes, progress, and (hopefully) breakthroughs along the way 😄  

Feel free to explore my projects or reach out if you’d like to connect!

## 🎯 Focus Points

**Current Goal:** Learn C fundamentals and get comfortable with WinAPI basics.  

**Next Steps:**

- Understand correlations between C/C++ and Assembly  
- Learn C++ fundamentals  
- Explore WinAPI in C++ & COM basics  
- Complete a full Assembly project  

## 🧩 Projects

**Currently working on:**  
- [Command-line Contact Manager](https://github.com/yourusername/contact-manager) – a first project to practice C fundamentals and structured programming.  

**Planned Projects:**
